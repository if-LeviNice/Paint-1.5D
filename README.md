# Paint-1.5D
Probably one of worst things I ever coded, but it was all for fun, even though it was not. I know it is confusing, my teacher wanted me to program something using winforms, and he gave me a poor code to print some colored squares randomly on the screen, so I made it a Paint thingy, hope it is much better than the original :D
